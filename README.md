# My_static_website_EJS
An assignment (M07T01) to practice deploying a static website that I coded using Bootstrap. Note that while this site "advertises" a store's baked goods, there is no such store! This is a demo site only. While all hyperlinks work, the buttons are non-functional. 
The website index.html should run as is without modification. The CSS file titled shopping_styleguide.css dictates the fonts, colors, and general appearence of the site. Finally, all images used in index.html are found in the images/ directory. All pictures were taken by the owner of this repository.
